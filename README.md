# Football Player Transfer Value Prediction Project
### Bachelor's Thesis Project
This repository contains all data processing and preparation code for developing an AI model to predict football players' transfer market values.

## Key Functionalities
### Data Preparation
Market Value History Processing:

Calculate Area Under Curve (AUC) for player value trajectories

Handle single-value cases with rectangle area method

Interpolate missing values in player histories

### Missing Data Solutions
Identify players missing from primary datasets

Implement strategies for handling incomplete records

Generate reports on data completeness

### Visualization
Player value history charts

Statistical distributions of market values

Model performance visualizations
